**Instructions for Testing the Application**

**Setup:**
-Ensure you have a web server with PHP installed (e.g., XAMPP, LAMP stack on Ubuntu).
-Save the HTML code as index.html and the PHP script as calculator.php in the same directory accessible by your web server.

**Running the Application:**
-Start your web server.
-Open your web browser and navigate to the location where you saved index.html (e.g., http://localhost/index.html).

**Testing:**
-Enter values in the input fields and select different operations from the dropdown menu.
-Click "Calculate" and observe the result displayed on the page.
-Test various combinations, including edge cases such as dividing by zero or taking the logarithm of a non-positive number, to ensure the application handles errors gracefully.

**Debugging:**
-If the result is not as expected, check the input values and ensure they are correct.
-Verify that the PHP script is correctly capturing and processing the form data.
-Use PHP error reporting (e.g., error_reporting(E_ALL);) to identify any issues in the code.
